# Let me explain what I am trying to do:

# write a code to scrap name, price and availability like "on sale" OR "sold" from "https://bestofusedbooks.com/" website

# Imported the dependencies:
from bs4 import BeautifulSoup as bs
import requests


# write the name of book that you want to scrap
book_name = input("search:")
book_name = book_name.title()
bestofusedbooks_url = "https://bestofusedbooks.com/search?q=" + book_name
print(bestofusedbooks_url)

'''
now this url will show us lots of result , for if I enter book_name = who moved my cheese? ,
it will show that there 2 page available for this search
'''


try:
    source = requests.get(bestofusedbooks_url)
    source.raise_for_status()
    soup = bs(source.text,'html.parser')
    Unclean = soup.find('main',class_="main-content js-focus-hidden")
    clean = Unclean.find('ul',class_="list--inline pagination")
    page_string = clean.find('li',class_="pagination__text").text
    page_string = page_string.split()
    a= int(page_string[1])
    b= int(page_string[3])
    print(type(a))
    print(b)

except Exception as e:
    print(e)
"""
what I am trying to do in above code is that it will search how many pages is there, it will be available 
in this format "Page 1 of 2" , so i have a write code[(page_string = clean.find('li',class_="pagination__text").text] 
as it will be in string format and the aliments will be the same by aliments I mean this "Page 1 of 2" and then I can
fetch it using indexing , so I can get run a loop from x page to y page and fetch the data (name,price and availability)
"""

"""
Earlier the code was running but not for a particular record ,if I change the book_name , then it's code is not 
working , as of now if not running
"""

'''
By doing so I can get the all the records and then store it in a csv or xlsx and from that I can check the name of the
book and then print the price and availability.
'''

# the above code is only to get the number of pages
